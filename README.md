# My description of BDMO

## Steps

1. Online Round: You will have to go to this [site](https://online.matholympiad.org.bd/). You will have to answer 15-20 questions. (only answer, no explanation). You will get nothing after winning this round. (District Level).

2. Divisional Round: You will have to go to the exam hall (usually Ideal School & College) and you will have to answer in the question paper (only answer, usually 10 questions). But you will be given extra papers for the explanation but you may skip the explanation. You will get a medal and t-shirt if you pass this exam. (Division Level).

3. National Round: You will have to go to the exam hall (usually St. Joseph Higher Secondary School) and you will have to answer in the same way as the previous round but the explanation is mandatory. You will get a medal and t-shirt but if you are first, second or third in you category, you may get prize money and trophy as well. (County Level).

4. National Camp: Winners from national round will have the chance to go there. But winners of primary category may not go there. Only top 3 of junior category and winners of secondary and higher secondary category will go there. Trainers will teach you some Maths and at the end you will have to give an exam (staring from this camp, only English solutions are allowed, you will have to stay there).

5. Extension Camp: If you are selected (usually around 30-40 students can go there) in this camp, next year you will have the access to go to national camp even if you fail the previous exams. You will be taught advanced topics by the seniors and trainers. At the end, you will have to give an exam.

6. IMO Camp: Only 8-10 students can participate in this camp. This is mainly a camp for exams. However they may reach you something. Only 6 of them will go to IMO.

7. IMO (International Mathematical Olympiad): This is our main goal.

## Category
